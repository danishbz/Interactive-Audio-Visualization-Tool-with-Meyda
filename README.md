# Voice_Controller_and_Audio_Visualisation_with_Meyda

This project is a creative coding endeavor aimed at developing an interactive audio visualization tool using JavaScript. Leveraging the p5.js library, the tool provides users with a canvas to control audio playback and visualize sound features in real-time. The project marries audio analysis with engaging visual feedback, making it a joy to explore sound through code.

# Features

Audio Playback Control: Control playback with a play/pause button, and a button to jump to random times in the track.
Volume, Rate, and Pan Adjustments: Use sliders to tweak the audio's volume, playback rate, and stereo panning.
Real-Time Audio Visualization: Visualize sound characteristics such as RMS (Root Mean Square), spectral centroid, and more, with dynamic updates.
Speech Recognition Control: The background color of the canvas can change based on recognized voice commands, adding an interactive dimension.

# Getting Started

Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the project repository.

git clone <repository-url>
    ```

Setup: Ensure that the necessary JavaScript libraries, such as p5.js and Meyda, are included.
Load Audio: Replace the existing audio file with your desired .mp3 file in the sounds directory.
Run: Open index.html in your browser to run the visualization tool.

# Usage

Buttons: Click 'Play' to toggle audio playback and 'Hop' to jump randomly across the audio track.
Sliders: Adjust the sliders on the canvas for volume, rate, and pan to see visual changes.
Speech Commands: Speak 'red', 'green', 'blue', 'black', or 'white' to change the canvas background color.

# Libraries and Tools

p5.js: A library for creative coding, simplifying the task of drawing and interaction.
Meyda: A powerful audio feature extractor used to analyze and represent sound characteristics.
Speech Recognition: Integrated using the p5.Speech library to capture and process voice commands.
